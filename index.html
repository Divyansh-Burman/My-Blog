  <p>This is a moive on how cars feel.I enjoyed this moive very much with my family.In thhis moive there is a Race Car Named "Lightning McQueen" he is a great race car and he wins all the races.But one day there was a tie between Lightning,Chick Hicks and The King so they has a tie braker round in Calfionia and the deal was the winner will get a Piston Cup and can de a Model of Dinoco, Lightning was very exited and he sits inside his truck named "Mack".Radiator Springs-a small town that made big changes to race car Lightning McQueen’s life and career. In the Pixar movie Cars, directed by John Lasseter, Lightning McQueen, a talented, but arrogant, rookie race car ends up in a town called Radiator Springs as he travels to California to compete for the Piston Cup. Unable to reach the outside world, he is stuck in the run-down town. Fortunately, through Lightning’s experiences with the cars of Radiator Springs, McQueen learns some important life lessons and finds some true friends. Some of the things I have learned from this movie are the importance of being a good “sport”, working well with others, and taking responsibility for all of your actions.

    First of all, from this movie, I’ve learned about the value of having good sportsmanship. In Cars, Lightning McQueen learned that there’s a whole lot more to racing than just winning. In the beginning of this movie, McQueen was an arrogant car who wouldn’t respect his pit crew, didn’t listen to The King’s advice, and he made fun of Chick, his opponent, after the race. In the end when The King is rendered no longer able to race, McQueen, demonstrating great amounts of sportsmanship, gave up the Piston Cup to help The King finish the race. With this in mind, I can surely transfer Lightning McQueen’s great deed into my life. I can demonstrate sportsmanship in any type of athletic game, such as in P.E., or even when I play tennis. Being a good sport can mean just shaking hands with an opponent after a tennis match, or saying “good job” after a game to the opposing team regardless of the result. By bringing in sportsmanship into everything I do, I can create a good connection with my opponent. </p>

  <p>I enjoyed this moive too much about.It tells a emotion on rats.A skinny rat named Remy dreams of being a great French chef despite being a rodent. He does not have his family’s support. Remy, a local rat with a keen sense of smell hates garbage and risks death to enter a human kitchen where he discovers authentic food and the cooking of Anton Gusteau, author of “Anyone Can Cook”. On the day Remy finds out that his beloved hero has died, he gets evicted and finds himself in the sewers of Paris directly beneath the restaurant made famous by his culinary hero Auguste Gusteau. The restaurant is now run by a frozen food hawking chef. Linguini a clumsy youth enters the same time as Remy and is hired as a garbage boy. To save the soup that Linguini accidentally fouls, Remy throws in some ingredients; and the soup is a success and Linguini’s career as a chef begins.

    Remy teams up with Linguini; Linguini cooks as Remy orchestrates the whole process from within Linguini’s chef cap. They create magic but live in constant fear that someone may discover their secret and object to a rodent running a five star kitchen. Along the way Remy learns important lessons about life, friends, and family. He decides to pursue his culinary calling despite his family wishing hi return to the life ofa sewer rat.
    
    Anton Ego a famed food critic hears of Linguini’s food and decided to sample it himself. He arrives at the restaurant and asks to be served whatever the cook fancies. Remi decides to serve Anton, Ratatouille. Eating Ratatouille transports Anton to his childhood and reminds him of his mother’s Ratatouille. Anton is impressed and insists on seeing the chef.This was very fun to watch.You must watch it too.</p>
